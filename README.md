# Welcome

Thank you for visiting my data mining repository. This repository includes all of the work that I have done in the field of data mining, including coursework and personal projects. 

## **What you Will Find Here**

In this repository, you will find folders which correspond to each personal project or course that I have completed. Each folder will contain the data used and the code written to complete the project, and will additionally include some notes on the new techniques and lessons that I learned from completing the project and/or course.

## **Courses and Projects**
Below is a brief introduction to each of the courses and projects that I have participated in:

### **1. Introduction to Data Mining**
This is a course that I, as of February 2023, am in the process of completing as part of my Master of Computer Science at UIUC. In this course, we focus on three major areas of data mining: pattern discovery, cluster analysis, and classification. 

Under each section of the course, there are two to three programming assignments that allow us to demonstrate our knowledge of the important concepts discussed in the course. These programming assignments are laid out as follows:

#### *Pattern Discovery*
* Mining Frequent Patterns in Transactions with the Apriori Algorithm
* Mining Contiguous Sequential Patterns in Text

#### *Cluster Analysis*
* Implementing the K-means Clustering Algorithm
* Implementing Hierarchical Clustering
* Implementing Clustering Validation Methods

#### *Classification*
* Implementing the Decision Tree Algorithm
* Implementing a Naive Bayes Classifier

Within the course folder, each project has its own folder that contains the data used in the assignment, the code used to complete the assignment, and some key takeaways from the assignment.

### *More Folders and Projects to Come Soon*!
Careers are nothing more than continuous learning, and as I continue to learn new techniques and apply them to new problems, the content associated with those projects and courses will be added here.
